			<Text>Moca Aoba, a slow voice can't hide deep affection, a mischievous smile can't conceal consideration. Her usual carefree cheerfulness can see into the deepest knots of the heart—after all, both bread and strategy are fermented wisdom. Perhaps past habits are only suited for amusing a small circle; but beyond point cards, there are similar wits. Just maintain that relaxed mindset, and fortune will surely come "kneading" your way.</Text>

			<Text>Always wearing a mischievous smile, Moca is the most mysterious member of Afterglow, skillfully evading any topic she doesn't wish to disclose, leaving even her four childhood friends not fully understanding her. While Moca usually seems to enjoy teasing her friends, she is actually the most perceptive among the band members, especially when it comes to caring for her companions, and is also the one who understands Ran the best.</Text>

			<Text>Moca is obsessed with bread, with Yamabuki Bakery's products being her favorite. With an astonishing appetite, Moca can easily eat over ten bread items in one sitting, then, true to her prankster nature, claims "the fat got transferred to Hi-chan". She also has a habit of collecting point cards, often trying to use them to get bread for "free".</Text>

			<Text>"Babanbo-sama" originates from Episode 12 of the mini-comedy anime "BanG Dream! Girls Band Party! PICO". In this episode, to cure Ran's persistent high fever, the other four members of Afterglow tried every folk remedy. Moca found information stating that "the Ungaruhoganga tribe believes illness is caused by demons; praying to the spirit Babanbo is said to bring recovery," so the group enshrined Ran along with offerings to summon the god.</Text>

			<Text>Moca enjoys collecting point cards, especially those from Yamabuki Bakery, and has even tried to pay solely with points (to get bread). She also once tried to share her sadness using Ran's rock microphone at CiRCLE studio because her point cards had expired.</Text>

			<Text>Just as Rimi loves chocolate coronet bread, Moca has her own favorite: melonpan. Melonpan resembles the Chinese "pineapple bun" but differs in texture and other aspects. It's a frequent guest in ACGN works, beloved by classic characters like Shana and Shiina Mashiro.</Text>

			<Text>"Lost One's Goukoku" is a famous Vocaloid song by Neru, using the Kagamine Rin voice library, reflecting the pain of students lost in the sea of academics. Afterglow's cover debuted in 2018, featuring Ayane Sakura's dedicated performance belting the high notes in the chorus, leading to the phrase "Sakura Throat Protection Association".</Text>
