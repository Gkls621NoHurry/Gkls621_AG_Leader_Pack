			<Text>Tsugumi Hazawa, diligent enough to be the foundation of the girl band life, progressive enough to be the vanguard of the childhood friends' unity. The greatness of the ordinary lies in supporting everyone's life, being steady and reliable, making "enjoying tea and snacks at leisure" an unextravagant common occurrence. And you have never been complacent, always striving for excellence; the dojo polished by ordinary strength will eventually bloom with a more perfect fragrance.</Text>

			<Text>The keyboardist of Afterglow, student council president of Hanasakigawa Girls' Academy, the initiator and spiritual pillar of the band. Possibly the most ordinary girl in BanG Dream! (her design leans somewhat towards being a background character), but precisely because she is ordinary, she is a hard worker who never gives up, no matter how small the task.</Text>

			<Text>Her family runs the "Hazawa Cafe," a famous shop in the local shopping district. Tsugumi is the cafe's poster girl, and other band girls like Eve also work part-time here. However, despite her family running a cafe, she herself dislikes drinking black coffee. Additionally, she has a special skill of being the fastest to find the brightest star after practice.</Text>

			<Text>Moca likes to call Tsugumi "Tsugu", and often teases with the word "Tsugumi," such as in backstage dialogue saying "Tsugu, have you Tsugu'd today?" and using this word to praise bread in comics.</Text>

			<Text>For a long time, Tsugumi might be famous as a data query bot related to "BanG Dream! Girls Band Party!". Commands like "ycm" ("Youchema?" - Any rooms available?) to query co-op rooms via the Tsugu bot, and Tsugu's reply "myc" ("Meiyouche!" - No rooms!) when no rooms are available, have been reverse-imported back into Tsugumi's character itself, becoming a sort of stereotype among players.</Text>

			<Text>As a common type of establishment, cafes can serve as a respite for petty bourgeois sentiments, aid students burning the midnight oil, and even nurture world-class stock exchanges. As for why it replaces the 'Medical Quarter,' it's probably for the selling convenient stimulants, helping those who haven't slept or haven't slept enough to 'fully recover.' It is said that traditional Italian espresso "Espresso" is meant to be ordered, the cup received immediately, and drunk in one gulp right at the counter.</Text>
